Single-product landing page with React.js 


Here, 
Creating a single-product landing page with React.js involves creating components for different sections of the page, such as header, product details, features, and a call-to-action (CTA) section.

Note that this is a basic template, and you might want to customize it further based on your specific needs.

Let's assume your project structure looks like this:

/src
  /components
    Header.js
    ProductDetails.js
    Features.js
    CallToAction.js
  App.js
  index.js
