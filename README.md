Single-product landing page with React.js 


Here, 
Creating a single-product landing page with React.js involves creating components for different sections of the page, such as header, product details, features, and a call-to-action (CTA) section.

Note that this is a basic template, and you might want to customize it further based on your specific needs.

Let's assume your project structure looks like this:

/src
  /components
    Header.js
    ProductDetails.js
    Features.js
    CallToAction.js
  App.js
  index.js

Here we called first product title via headerjs.

After that We can add Features and proudct js for information of the product. 

Then create a CallToAction.js file and create a section.

Now Import all files in APP.JS And insert product details. 

Remember to add your actual product details, features, and styling to make it visually appealing.
